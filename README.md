# Craft CMS Project

This is a Craft CMS site running locally with [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for development.

The project creates a theme using Twig rather than a headless approach.

## ðŸš€ Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)  
- [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) â€“ I use OrbStack  
- PHP 8.x (handled by DDEV)  
- Composer (handled by DDEV)  
- Node.js 18+ (weâ€™re using v22.x in this example)

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amparsons/craft-prototype.git
